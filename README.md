## Introduction

This repository hosts my final year project, which is a ROS package that estimated 3D human pose in the environment (the map) using deep-learning-techniques and the robot's integrated RGB-D camera. The wiki documentation goes into detailed information on how to set-up the environment and run the ROS package, however the RGB-D sensor is necessary for the correct execution of the estimation process.

The project, being open-source will always remain under active development, either by me or someone else who would be willing to take it over. So please do submit pull-requests if you think something could be done better (Check **wishlist** in the wiki).

Finally, the project was developed with Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS), ROS Indigo and Python3. The robot used was [TIAGO](http://tiago.pal-robotics.com/) by PAL Robotics.

## Run It

**Detailed** instructions on how to install, configure and run anything required by the project is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/itaouil/HARN/wiki). of the project.
